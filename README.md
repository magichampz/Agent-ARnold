# Agent-ARnold
### Augmented reality game developed in unity to train motor and cognitive skills of children with Cerebral Palsy

This app was created for the Pace Centre as part of my 2nd year project. The game was developed in Unity using the Vuforia Engine SDK for advanced image target tracking. Object interactions were coded with C#.

The game currently contains 2 subjects: Science and English. Each 3 levels of difficulties to cater to students of varying motor and cognitive capabilities. Some game screenshots of the AR environment are shown below (not all challenges are detailed below):

#### Level 1 : Snail challenges
Virtual button created on the card, when covered by the player the snail moves towards the plant
