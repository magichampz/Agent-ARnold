### Augmented reality game developed in unity to train motor and cognitive skills of children with Cerebral Palsy

This app was created for the Pace Centre as part of my 2nd year project. The game was developed in Unity using the Vuforia Engine SDK for advanced image target tracking. Object interactions were coded with C#.

The game currently contains 2 subjects: Science and English. Each 3 levels of difficulties to cater to students of varying motor and cognitive capabilities. Some game screenshots of the AR environment are shown below:

#### Level 1 : Snail challenges

The version control for this project was managed using plasticSCM, which is optimised for mixed reality development in unity. The software development for the project was done in collaboration with Michael Ma and Ziyao Dong.
