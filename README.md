# Agent-ARnold
## Augmented reality game developed to train motor and cognitive skills of children with Cerebral Palsy

This app was created for the Pace Centre as part of my 2nd year project. The game was developed in Unity using the Vuforia Engine SDK for advanced image target tracking. Object interactions were coded with C#

The game currently contains 2 subjects: Science and English. Each 3 levels of difficulties to cater to students of varying motor and cognitive capabilities. Some game screenshots of the AR environment are shown below (not all challenges are detailed below):

### Science
#### Level 1 : Snail challenges
Virtual button created on the card, when covered by the player the snail moves towards the plant

### English
All english questions for each level are the same, but the difference is the way in which the question is answered. Higher levels require a more difficult method of answering (more advanced motor skills required) <br>

Level 1: Players tap the correct option on the screen <br>
Level 2: Players drage the correct option on the screen to the blank <br>
Level 3: Players drag the correct option using their hand to touch the AR object in real life, which is projected on the screen <br>

Check out my medium article for more info on the project, including a video demonstration. The version control for this project was managed using plasticSCM, which is optimised for mixed reality development in unity. The software development for the project was done in collaboration with Michael Ma and Ziyao Dong.
